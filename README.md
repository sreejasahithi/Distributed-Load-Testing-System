Implemented a distributed load-testing system using Python and Kafka for communication.
Orchestrator and Driver nodes handle Tsunami and Avalanche testing, ensuring scalability from
three to nine nodes. Orchestrator exposes a REST API for test control and reporting, with a
Runtime controller managing heartbeats, load test coordination, and metric storage. Developed
Driver node for request handling, response recording, and Kafka communication. Emphasized
observability with a responsive dashboard.
